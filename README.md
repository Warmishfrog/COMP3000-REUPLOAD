Under the Crescent Moon is a First-person shooter Roguelike I am developing for my Computer Science (Games Development) degree final year project. For this, I've chosen to transition from C# in Unity to use C++ in Unreal Engine 5. 
The gameplay takes the player to a vast procedurally generated desert. As the sun sets the player must endure endless numbers of horrible creatures set out to eliminate the trespassing player who has found themselves lost in a place they really should have never set foot in. 
As the player defeats enemies they gain experience and level to upgrade their fighting capabilities with a variety of power-ups against an increasingly overwhelming horde.
The objective is to Survive 5 Minutes at which point the player has won but still has the option to continue playing.
